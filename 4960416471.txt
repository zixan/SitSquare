If you've bought something on Craigslist and need it moved..<br>
<br>
a table and chairs...<br>
a mattress..<br>
A piece of Furniture...<br>
a couch...<br>
a loveseat...<br>
Or a W/D, Fridge or Stove from someone online here and need them picked up and delivered quickly...<br>
<br>
i can do it for a fee of $59 (keep in mind that if there's multiple pieces, i may have to charge more based on extra time and labor)...<br>
<br>
I am very reliable, and ALWAYS early for appointments..! (**I do charge an extra $10 for jobs around the 10 and north 605 freeways due to my location..)<br>
<br>
If you need the old appliance hauled and dumped, i can do it for an additional $20.. I can also install your Washer/Dryer for an extra $10.<br>
