Thanks for checking out "Knotty Slices" custom upcycled & reclaimed custom furniture and art! This is an "offshoot" of our other business IB Crazy Coops. <br>
<br>
We usually have a lot of unused wood from building our beautiful custom chicken coops, and in an effort to preserve our precious resources, we continue use everything possible in order to keep from adding to the landfills by going green and using what is left!<br>
<br>
I create furniture, home decor accessories and one of a kind original art pieces (including a new series of wood wall sculpture pieces inspired from the TV show walking Dead).<br>
<br>
All items are uniquely made from pallets, pallet planks, wooden wire/cable reels & spools, downed trees & more. I've been doing this for years and my reputation precedes me through my celebrity work.<br>
<br>
Our artwork is primarily crafted from wood / tree slices and tree rings from downed trees. Our wall hangings are unique wood sculptures of abstract design<br>
<br>
Our home decor is also made from downed trees and includes items such as tea light holders (we call them Tree Light Holders) and coat racks.<br>
<br>
Our furniture is durable, modern rustic in style and most off all made carefully by hand right down to the finish.<br>
<br>
You can buy from us locally (we are in San Diego) or visit our Etsy store (KnottySlices) https://www.etsy.com/shop/KnottySlices where you will find prices and more designs and items!  Alternatively, we can ship and personally deliver larger items out of the area if needed<br>
