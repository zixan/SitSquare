We are a family owned small business, we have been in the event industry for 7 years and have furnished 100's of weddings. I deliver every lounge myself with my younger brother and I'm familiar with almost every venue in OC/LA. I also custom paint/redo old vintage pieces into modern baroque custom art pieces. We have some of the most unique rental inventory out there and have several unique pieces that are my own designs (Medallion sofa/parlor chair/Ornate Coffee/Kings chair).<br>
<br>
Give us a call or email for pricing, we are very reasonable because we have low overhead and do everything ourselves. Our pieces are just as nice if not nicer then any of the big rental companies out there, I invite anyone who is interested in using us to come by and meet with me and see our beautiful pieces in person.<br>
