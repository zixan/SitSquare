A blue fabric couch is for sale. 91 inches wide, 36 inches deep and 35 inches tall. From a smoke-free, pet-free home. One owner. Some scrapes, scuffs on wood (see pictures) but all in all a very decent couch. No rips or stains. Never had pets on it. (We're allergic.) Purchased in the early '90s, so this is sturdy furniture, not the flimsy stuff you buy today. You'll need a truck to pick this up. Cash only. No $100 bills.<br>
