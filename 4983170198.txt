<br>
Chaise Lounge Chair - $890/ea + $72 tax = $962/ea<br>
Lounge Chair - $305/ea  + $25 tax = $330/ea<br>
SideTable - $190/ea + $16 tax = $206/ea<br>
<br>
Our Discounted Price:<br>
<br>
Chase Lounge Chair - $750/ea (final price)<br>
Lounge Chair - $250/ea (final price)<br>
Side Table - $150/ea (final price)<br>

We are selling 4 chaise lounge chairs, 2 regular lounge chairs and 4 side tables.  THERE IS NO NEGOTIATION ON THE PRICE!!!  Please do not ask for a lower price.  You must pick up the furniture. We will accept payment by cash, venmo, or cashiers check.  Serious buyers only.<br>
